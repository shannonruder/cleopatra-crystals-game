# Crystals Collector game
This is a game using jquery code library. 

Make an offering to Cleopatra. Help her solve the mysteries of crystal values in the ancient Egypt by simple matching crystals to add up to her crystal quota (randomized math value).

You must choose any combinations of crystals to match her target crystal quota. The value of the crystals will change with each game.  Click on one or more valuable jewels to match the target score for a win. If your score goes over the beginning target value, you lose the game. 

Instructions: 1. Click on any gem to figure out their values. 2. Your goal is to continue adding gems until the total value matches the target score you are given. A successful collection of crystals will be considered a win. Collecting too many crystals that go over your given target value will cause you to lose the crystal collector's game.
